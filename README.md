Hello! I started training on the React framework on February 1, 2033. And this is my first introductory project. I want to share with you the first game I wrote on React, and start the countdown to the complete completion of the course. I will leave this project here as a reminder of the times when I spent my evenings after work doing my favorite thing))) Thank you!
